# üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant information such as income, employment status, marital status, credit history, and education. The model is trained using logistic regression ‚Äî a widely used algorithm for binary classification problems.

# üìà Project Overview

Loan approval prediction is a common task in financial analytics. By using applicant details such as income, employment status, credit history, and loan amount, we aim to build a logistic regression model that predicts loan approval (Approved or Not Approved).

This can help financial institutions streamline their decision-making process and assess loan risk more efficiently.
